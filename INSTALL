General instructions
====================

These general instructions will build the binary and library versions of
trackcpp, and also the python package. Before starting, read the requirements
in the sections below. If you intend


REQUIREMENTS

(See below).


INSTRUCTIONS

1. Compile with 'make all'.

2. Install with 'make install' or, alternatively, install a symbolic link to
the local compiled versions with 'make develop'.



trackcpp
========


REQUIREMENTS

- a C++ compiler with C++11 support (tested with GCC 4.8)
- pthread
- blas
- gsl (GNU Scientific Library)


INSTRUCTIONS

1. Compile with 'make all'.

2. Install trackcpp with 'make install'. The installation directory is
$(DEST_DIR), with DEST_DIR=/usr/local/bin by default. Alternatively, install a
symbolic link to the local compiled version with 'make develop'.



trackcpp Python package
=======================


REQUIREMENTS

- a C++ compiler with C++11 support (tested with GCC 4.8)
- blas
- gsl (GNU Scientific Library)
- SWIG 2 (tested with SWIG 2.0.11)
- Python 3 (tested with Python 3.4) with header files
- Python setuptools (>=16.0)
- libtrackcpp.a (see previous section)


INSTRUCTIONS

1. Check include and library paths in Makefile. On a Linux system, the default
options should work (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS); if necessary, alter the
paths. An auxiliary script named 'compile' is provided and may be helpful on
Mac OS X.

2. Run 'make all'.

3. Install the package with 'make install'. This will run 'python3 setup.py
install', installing the Python package to a default location. Arguments to
the command can be supplied through the variable SETUPARGS. Alternatively, the
development version can be installed by running 'make develop', which will run
'python3 setup.py develop' instead; arguments can be supplied the same way.
